        <p>The Republic of Singapore is an island nation located in Southeast Asia. The reason why I love Singapore the most is because Singapore is a very successful country. For example, Singapore:</p>
            <li>has a high GDP per capita (82 807 USB)</li>
            <li>is the safest country in Asia</li>
            <li>has affordable public housing</li>
            <li>has been ruled by the People's Action Party since independence</li>
            <li>is one of the least corrupt societies in the world</li>

        <p>Singapore is a successful country because of its strict laws. Citizens of Singapore required to serve in the military for two years. Citizens of Singapore cannot have dual citizenship. 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of cocaine, 250 grams of math, or 500 grams of cannabis will lead to the death penalty in Singapore.</p>
        <p>Singapore has laws on the display of flags as well. The Guidelines for the Use of the National Flag of the National Symbols Act 2022 and Regulations was created to regulate the use of the Singaporean flag. Article 2 states that when the National Flag of Singapore is displayed outside a building, it must be flown from a flagpole in front of the building, and must not be flown at night without proper illumination. However, during the National Day celebrations period (1 July to 30 September) or any other period declared by the Minister, the National Flag may be displayed on a building without requiring a flagpole or night illumination.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Thing 2.</h2>
        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" target="_blank">Hong Kong</a></h2>
        <hr>
        <img src = "Image/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png" width="700">
        <h6>Flag of Hong Kong</h6>
        <hr>
        <p>The Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong is one of my favourite things because Hong Kong is a global hub for trade and business. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, and many of the city's culture and customs originate from a mix of Chinese and British customs. British influence is still prevalent over the city, over 25 years since the city's handover back to China. For example:</p>
            <ol>- English is an official language of Hong Kong</ol>
            <ol>- Old British buildings are still seen in the skyline of Hong Kong</ol>
            <ol>- Hong Kong has adopted a free-market economy</ol>
        <p>The other reason why I love Hong Kong is because of its fascinating history. The city started off as a fishing village, but was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, following the First Opium War. The island of Hong Kong was then established as a British crown colony. After the Second Opium War, the Kowloon penninsula was also ceded to the British, and the New Territories were leased for 99 years from 1898.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong grew to a population of 350 000 by 1900, after the British developed the area. Buildings with British architecture were built during this period, such as the Queen's Building. Hong Kong was then established as a trading hub for the British.</p>

        <p>During the December of 1941, Hong Kong was attacked by the Japanese. On the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbour, Japanese forces landed in the British crown colony of Hong Kong. Units from Britain, India, and Canada fought to defend the city from the Japanese. The Japanese first landed in the Northern District of Hong Kong. Within a day, the British retreated to Tai Po, and later back to Sha Tin. In two days, the Japanese pushed the British back towards the Gin Drinkers Line, and three days later, the Japanese have occupied the entirely of the Kowloon peninsula.</p>

        <h6>Battle of Hong Kong</h6>
        <hr>
        <p>Battles on Hong Kong Island, the most important part of the colony, lasted for over one week. The Japanese approached the island from the east, landing in mordern day Quarry Bay. The Japanese moved west towards Wan Chai, the city's financial district, and marched south over Mount Butler. The British soon retreated to Stanley, the southern most point of Hong Kong, and were driven out by the Japanese by December 22.</p>
        <p>From 23 December 1941 until the end of WWII, Hong Kong was under Japanese occupation. During the occupation, thousands of civillians were tortured, and small rations were given to the civillians to conserve food for soldiers. Many fled towards Mainland China to escape the Japanese.</p>
        <p>After the liberation of Hong Kong, many businesses relcoated their offices from Shanghai. Hong Kong was transformed into an industrial city. The manufacturing industry drove many out of unemployment, and the textile industry boosted the economy significantly in the following decade.</p>
        <p>In the 1970s, Hong Kong extended the government subsidised education from six years to nine years. The opening of the Chinese market and rising salaries drove many manufacturers north. Hong Kong consolidated its position as a commercial and tourism centre in Asia. High life expentancy, literacy, per-capita income and other socio-economic measures attest to Hong Kong's achievements over the last four decades of the 20th century. Higher income also led to the introduction of the first high-rise, private housing estates.</p>
        <p>In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher hoped that the increasing openness of the Chinese government and economic reform would allow the continuation of British rule over the colony. The resulting meeting led to the signing of Sino-British Joint Declaration and the proposal of the One country, two systems concept by Deng Xiaoping. At this time, Hong Kong was recognized as one of the wealthiest cities in Asia, but the coming handover back to China raised emigration levels to the highest it has ever been in the history of the city. Many Hong Kongers immigrated to the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, and other Commonwealth countries.</p>
        <p>In 1990, the Hong Kong Basic Law was officially accepted as the constitution of Hong Kong after the handover. The pro-Beijing parties supported the Basic Law, but the pro-democratic parties criticised it. On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was officially handed over to the People's Republic of China by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Legislative Council was replaced by the Provisional Legislative Council, appointed by the Chinese goverment.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Thing 3.</h2>
        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau" target="_blank">Macau</a></h2>
        <img src = "Image/Flag_of_Macau.svg.png" width="700">
        <p>The Special Administrative Region of Macau is a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. The reason why I love the city of Macau is because it is a very interesting place. Macau is the most densely populated region of the world, with a population of 680 000 but only an area of 32.9 kilometres squared. Macau was a Portuguese colony until 1999, when it was officially returned to China.</p>
        <p>Macau uses the Macanese pataca (MOP), and its timezone is UTC+08:00 (Macau Standard Time) </p>
        <p>I like Macau because it has many unique qualities. Macau is the only place where gambling is legal in the People's Republic of China. Macau is the only place in the world where Portuguese and Chinese culture have fused together. The local language, Macanese Patua, is a Portugese-based creole langauge with influences from Cantonese and Malay. It is a critically endangered language, as only 50 native speakers remain. There have been efforts to preserving the language, such as online dictionaries and the language being taught as a secondary language.</p>
        <p>Throughout Portuguese rule over the peninsula, Macanese patua was rarely used in favour of Macanese Portuguese. Portugese remains an official language of the Special Administrative Region today, along with Mandarin Chinese, although Cantonese is the most widely spoken language in Macau.</p>

        <h6>Macau's Central District</h6>
        <hr>
        <p>Because of its gambling industry, Macau is extremely rich. Its GDP per capita is $55 000, right between France and the UK. Macau has a 1.9% unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>Macau was colonized by the Portuguese from 1557 to 1999. During WWII, the United States ordered air raids on Macau after learning that the colonial government was selling aviation fuel to Japan. The Japanese respected Portuguese soverignty over the peninsula, and it became a hub for refugees, fleeing from Hong Kong or other parts of East Asia.</p>
        <p>The Portuguese constructed many Portugese-styled buildings in Macau during their rule. Portugal also spread Christianity into the region through missionaries. Currently, Macau only has a 7% Christian population.</p>
